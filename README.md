# DataScienceCapstone


## ðŸ“‘ Summary
This is the final capstone of the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" that combines all the course content into one project. The project aims to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully and to find the optimal place for the rocket launches.

My Certificate can be found <a href=https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/8YX3K3W9C857>here</a>.

### Business Understanding
SpaceX is able to launch Falcon 9 rockets at a cost of approximately $62m which is far cheaper than other providers. The cost saving comes form the ability to land and reuse the first stage of the rockets. If we can make predictions on whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a rocket launch and use this information to assess whether or not an alternate company should bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## ðŸ“‘ Main Topics
The project includes the folowing steps:

1. [Data Collection](https://github.com/MariusLandwich/DataScienceCapstone/tree/main/01.%20Data%20Collection)
   - GET Requests to the SpaceX REST API
   - Web Scrapping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page
3. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/MariusLandwich/DataScienceCapstone/tree/main/02.%20Data%20Wrangling)
   - Using the `.fillna()` method to remove all of the NaN values
   - `.value_counts()` method to determine the following:
        - Number of launches on each site
        - Number and occurrence of each orbit
        - Number and occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type
   - Creating a landing outcome label that shows the following:
        - 0 when the booster did not land successfully
        - 1 when the booster did land successfully
5. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/MariusLandwich/DataScienceCapstone/tree/main/03.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
6. [Interactice Visual Analytics](https://github.com/MariusLandwich/DataScienceCapstone/tree/main/04.%20Visual%20Analytics)
7. [Predictive Analytics (Classifiaction)](https://github.com/MariusLandwich/DataScienceCapstone/tree/main/05.%20Predictive%20Analytics%20(Classification))
